**Stalwart SMTP** is a modern SMTP server developed in Rust with a focus on security, speed, and extensive configurability. 
It features built-in DMARC, DKIM, SPF and ARC support for message authentication, strong transport security through DANE, MTA-STS and SMTP TLS reporting, and offers great flexibility and customization thanks to its dynamic configuration rules and native support for Sieve scripts.

Key features:

- Sender and Message Authentication:
  - Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (**DMARC**) verification and failure/aggregate reporting.
  - DomainKeys Identified Mail (**DKIM**) verification, signing and failure reporting.
  - Sender Policy Framework (**SPF**) policy evaluation and failure reporting.
  - Authenticated Received Chain (**ARC**) verification and sealing.
  - Reverse IP (**iprev**) validation.
- Strong Transport Security:
  - DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (**DANE**) Transport Layer Security.
  - SMTP MTA Strict Transport Security (**MTA-STS**).
  - SMTP TLS Reporting (**TLSRPT**) delivery and analysis.
- Inbound Filtering and Throttling:
  - Sieve scripting language with support for all [registered extensions](https://www.iana.org/assignments/sieve-extensions/sieve-extensions.xhtml).
  - Filtering, modification and removal of MIME parts or headers.
  - DNS block lists (**DNSBL**) & Greylisting.
  - Inbound concurrency & rate limiting.
  - Integration with external content filtering systems such as SpamAssassin and ClamAV.
- Flexible Queues:
  - Unlimited virtual queues with custom routing rules.
  - Delayed delivery with `FUTURERELEASE` and `DELIVERBY` extensions support.
  - Priority delivery with `MT-PRIORITY` extension support.
  - Outbound throttling & Disk quotas.
- Logging and Reporting:
  - Detailed logging of SMTP transactions and events, including delivery attempts, errors, and policy violations.
  - Integration with **OpenTelemetry** to enable monitoring, tracing, and performance analysis of SMTP server operations.
  - Automatic analysis of incoming DMARC/TLS aggregate reports, DMARC/DKIM/SPF authentication failure reports as well as abuse reports.
- And more:
  - SASL authentication.
  - PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL and SQLite support.
  - Granular configuration rules.
  - REST API for management.
  - Memory safe (thanks to Rust).

## Roadmap

The following major features and enhancements are planned for Stalwart SMTP:

- Embedded Antispam and Antivirus
- WASM filters
- Distributed mode
- Web-based administration

## Testing & Fuzzing

The base tests perform protocol compliance tests as well as basic functionality testing on different functions across the Stalwart SMTP code base. 
To run the base test suite execute:

```bash
cargo test
```

To run the fuzz tests please refer to the Stalwart libraries that handle parsing for the SMTP server: [smtp-proto](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/smtp-proto),
[mail-parser](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-parser),
[mail-auth](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/mail-auth) and [sieve-rs](https://github.com/stalwartlabs/sieve). 

## Funding

Part of the development of this project was funded through the [NGI0 Entrust Fund](https://nlnet.nl/entrust), a fund established by [NLnet](https://nlnet.nl/) with financial support from the European Commission's [Next Generation Internet](https://ngi.eu/) programme, under the aegis of DG Communications Networks, Content and Technology under grant agreement No 101069594.
